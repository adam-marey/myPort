        About Me
      </h1>

        I am a Full-Stack Web Developer and current Computer Science student at
        the Grand Canyon University. If I were to describe myself in one word,
        it would be resourceful. Where there is a will there is a way and that
        is what I always keep in mind when coding. I always try to think outside
        the box and find creative ways to solve problems. If you asked me what
        keeps me motivated to continuously learn, I would say challenge all the
        way. I do the thing that scares me the most, proudly and patiently. What
        I love about coding is that it keeps me on my toes. It is a combination
        of frustration, happiness, uncharted territory, an amalgam of
        information and so much more. I would not have it any other way.
